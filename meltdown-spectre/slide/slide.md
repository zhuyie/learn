# Caches
* Why do CPUs need Caches?
  - [The Gap between Processor and Memory Speeds](http://gec.di.uminho.pt/discip/minf/ac0102/1000gap_proc-mem_speed.pdf)
* How does CPU Cache work?
  - SRAM vs. DRAM
  - 1~10 ns vs. 100+ ns
  - 32KB~8MB vs. 4GB~32GB
  - data is transferred between memory and cache in blocks of fixed size, called cache lines.
  - temporal locality and spatial locality.

# Spectre V1 PoC
* [Spectre Paper](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
* ![](Conditional_Branch_Example.png)
* The code fragment begins with a bounds check on x which
is essential for security. In particular, this check **prevents** the
processor from reading sensitive memory **outside of array1**.
* What if we supplying x = (address of a **secret byte** to read) − (base address of array1) and a **branch misprediction** occurred?

# Spectre V1 wrap-up
*  Key ideas: **mistrains** the CPU's branch predictor, causing the CPU to temporarily **violate program semantics** by executing code that would not have been executed otherwise.
* The unoptimized implementation of the above PoC can read around **10 KB/s** on an i7-4650U with a low (< 0.01%) error rate.
* Can be **remotely exploited** by code hosted on web pages, for example interpreted languages like **JavaScript**, which run locally using a **web browser**. The scripted malware would then have access to all the memory mapped to the address space of the running browser.

# Meltdown PoC
* [Meltdown Paper](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
* ![h:70](meltdown-poc-1.png)![h:150](meltdown-poc-2.png)
* Line 4 reads from a kernel address, the load **succeed internally**, but will raise an exception when this instruction **retired**.
* Line 5-7 might be executed **before** line 4 retired due to OoO.
* When line 4 is retired, the **exception** is registered, and the **pipeline** is flushed to eliminate all results of subsequent instructions.

---
# Meltdown PoC
* Meltdown consists of 3 steps:
  1. The content of an attacker-chosen memory location, which is inaccessible to the attacker, is **loaded** into a register.
  2. A transient instruction **accesses** a cache line based on the secret content of the register.
  3. The attacker uses **Flush+Reload** to determine the accessed cache line and hence the secret stored at the chosen memory location.

# Meltdown wrap-up
* Key ideas: 
  1. Each process has a single full page table. 
  2. Vulnerable out-of-order CPUs allow an unprivileged process to load data from a privileged address.
  3. There is a race condition between raising the exception and a cache attack.
* The PoC can read **582 KB/s** with a low error rate on i7-8700K.
* Meltdown **breaks** all security guarantees provided by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments.

* Spectre V1 (Bounds Check Bypass)
  - **Compiler** change; Recompiled **system binaries** distributed by Windows Updates.
  - Edge & IE11 **hardened** to prevent exploit from JavaScript.
* Meltdown (Rogue Data Cache Load)
  - **Isolate** kernel and user mode **page tables**.

# Mitigations - MSVC /Qspectre
* For Intel and similar processors the **LFENCE** instruction will stop younger instructions from executing, even speculatively, before older instructions have retired. 
* An LFENCE instruction inserted **after a bounds check** will **prevent** younger operations from executing before the bound check retires. Therefore it can act as a **speculation barrier**.
* The MSVC compiler has been updated with support for the /Qspectre switch which will **automatically** insert one of these **speculation barriers** when the compiler **detects** instances of variant 1.

# Mitigations - KPTI
* [The current state of kernel page-table isolation](https://lwn.net/Articles/741878/)
* In old kernels, each process has a **single** page global directory (PGD). one of the first steps taken in the KPTI is to create a **second** PGD.
* The original remains in use when the kernel is running; it maps the full address space. The second is made active when the process is running in **user space**. It points to the same directory hierarchy for pages belonging to the process itself, but the portion describing kernel space is **mostly absent**.
* **Switch** page table when enter/exit kernel space.

---
# Mitigations - KPTI
* KPTI will affect performance for anything that does **system calls** or **interrupts**. Just the new instructions (CR3 manipulation) add a few hundred cycles to a syscall or interrupt.
* Old CPUs (without PCIDs) require a **TLB flush** when switching the page table, which hurt performance badly.
* For database engine PostgreSQL the impact on read-only tests on an Intel Skylake processor was 7–17% (or 16–23% without PCIDs). [link](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20180102222354.qikjmf7dvnjgbkxe%40alap3.anarazel.de)
