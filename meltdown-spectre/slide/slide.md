# Intel's Response
![w:900](vulnerabilities-3.png)
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/side-channel-variants-1-2-3.html

---
# Meltdown
* Meltdown exploits **side effects** of **out-of-order** execution on modern processors to **read arbitrary kernel-memory** locations including personal data and passwords.
* The attack is independent of the operating system, and it does not rely on any software vulnerabilities.
* Meltdown breaks all **security guarantees** provided by **address space isolation** as well as paravirtualized environments.

---
# Spectre
* Spectre is a class of security vulnerabilities that affects modern microprocessors that perform **branch prediction**.
* Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to **speculatively** perform operations that **would not occur** during correct program execution and which **leak** the victim’s conﬁdential information via a **side channel** to the adversary.
* JIT engines used for **JavaScript** were found to be vulnerable. A website can read data stored in the browser for another website, or the browser's memory itself.

---
# Variants
![w:900](variants.png)

---
# What is a side channel?
From Wikipedia:

“… a side-channel attack is any attack based on **information** gained from the **physical implementation** of a cryptosystem, rather than brute force or theoretical weaknesses in the **algorithms**. For example, **timing information**, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited to break the system.”

# Caches
* Why do CPUs need Caches?
  - [The Gap between Processor and Memory Speeds](http://gec.di.uminho.pt/discip/minf/ac0102/1000gap_proc-mem_speed.pdf)
* How does CPU Cache work?
  - **SRAM** vs. DRAM
  - 1~10 ns vs. 100+ ns
  - 32KB~8MB vs. 32+ GB
  - Data is transferred between memory and cache in blocks of fixed size, called **cache lines**.
  - Temporal **locality** and Spatial locality.

# Performance Impact of Cache
![h:500](cache-performance-impact-4.png)

# Performance Impact of Cache
![h:500](cache-performance-impact-5.png)

---
# System Protection
* User programs typically not trusted:
  * May use unfair amount of resources
  * May maliciously cause other programs or OS to fail
* System provides two CPU modes:
  * **User mode**: Some access to hardware resources restricted
  * **Kernel mode**: Full access to hardware resources

---
# How CPU Modes are implemented
* A modern CPU typical provides different **protection rings**, which represent different **privilege levels**.
* E.g., an x86 CPU usually provides 4 rings, and a Windows OS uses **Ring 0** for the kernel mode and **Ring 3** for the user mode.
![h:300](priv_rings.svg)

---
# Kernel Mode vs. User Mode
* A **fault** in the user space (e.g., divided by zero, invalid access, null pointer dereference) can be captured by the Kernel (without crashing the whole system).
* **Privileged instructions** can only be issued in the kernel mode.
  - E.g., disk I/O.
  - – In x86, an attempt to execute them from ring 3 leads to GP (General Protection) exceptions.
* The **kernel memory space** can only be accessed in the kernel mode.
  - E.g., the list of processes for scheduling.

---
# System Calls
* If I/O operations rely on privileged instructions, how does a **user program** read/write?
* **System calls**.
* When a system call is issued, the process goes **from** user mode (Ring 3) **to** kernel mode (Ring 0).
* **printf** call (Ring 3) => **write** system call => Kernel code (Ring 0).

---
# System Calls
![h:500](syscall.png)

---
# Virtual Memory
* Motivation:
  * Processes would like their memory to be **protected** from access and modification by other processes.
  * The operating system needs to be **protected** from applications.
  * By using **swap file** the operating system can use more RAM than it actually has.
  * **Programmers** would like each process see its own, full, address space.

---
# Virtual Memory
* Basic idea:
  * Each process has its own **Virtual Address Space**, divided into fixed-sized **pages**.
  * Virtual pages that are in use get **mapped** to pages of physical memory (called page frames).
    * Virtual memory: pages
    * Physical memory: frames
  * Virtual pages not recently used may be stored on **disk**.

---
# Virtual and Physical Memory

---
# Sharing Memory using Virtual Aliases
![w:820](virtual-memory-2.png)

---
# Virtual Address Space
![h:330](virtual-address-space.png)
In 32-bit Windows, the total available virtual address space is 2^32 bytes (4 GB). Usually the lower 2 GB are used for user space, and the upper 2 GB are used for system space.

---
# How to Finding the Physical Page
* OS uses some data structures that maps virtual pages to physical page frames: **Page Table** (PT).
* The OS **updates** the PT with a new mapping whenever it allocates a page frame to a virtual page.
* PT is accessed on a memory request to translate virtual to physical address → **inefficient!**
  * Solution: **cache** translations (TLB)
* One PT per **process**.

---
# Page Tables and Address Translation
![w:820](virtual-memory-3.png)

---
# x86 32-Bit PTE
![h:400](page-table-entry.png)
bit 2: if 0, user-mode accesses are not allowed to the 4KB page referenced by this entry.

---
# Making Page Tables space-efficient
* The number of entries in the table is the number of virtual pages:
  * e.g., 4KB pages
  * 2^20 entries for a 32b address space → need **4MB/process**.
  * 2^52 entries for a 64b address space → petabytes per process!
*  The virtual address space of each process is **sparse** → only a fraction of all virtual addresses actually used.
* Solutions:
  * multi-level page table (x86)
  * inverted page table (PowerPC, UltraSPARC)

---
# x86 Two-level page table

---
# Fast address translation: TLB
![w:850](tlb.png)

---
# Scalar Processor
* The simplest sort of modern processor executes **one instruction per cycle** (IPC=1, or CPI=1); we call this a scalar processor.
![w:500](scalar-processor-1.png) ![w:500](scalar-processor-2.png)
* Examples of scalar processors include the Intel 486 and the ARM1176 core used in Raspberry Pi Zero.

---
# Superscalar Processor
* Remember the execute stage in particular is really made up of **several** different groups of logic (several sets of gates).
![w:400](superscalar-processor-1.png)
* We can duplicating HW for IF/ID/WB, then we can **simultaneously** dispatching multiple instructions to different execution units.
![w:550](superscalar-processor-2.png)  (CPI=0.33 ?)

---
# Is superscalar good enough?
* Instructions interact with each other in pipeline:
![h:50](hazards-1.png) ![h:110](hazards-2.png)
* May depend on something produced by an earlier instruction:
  * Dependence may be for a data value: **data hazard**
  * Dependence may be for the next instruction’s address (branches, exceptions): **control hazard**
* May need a resource being used by another instruction in the pipeline: **structural hazard**

---
# Types of Data Hazards
* Data-dependence
![w:500](hazards-3.png)
* Anti-dependence
![w:500](hazards-4.png)
* Output-dependence
![w:500](hazards-5.png)

---
# Data Flow Analysis
![w:750](data-flow-analysis.png)

---
# Register Renaming
* Anti and output dependencies are **not true dependencies**.
  - The same register refers to values that have nothing to do with each other.
  - They exist due to lack of register ID’s (i.e. names) in the ISA.
* The register ID is **renamed** to the **reorder buffer** (ROB) entry that will hold the register’s value.
* This eliminates anti and output dependencies.

---
# Speculative Execution
* Whenever a RAW/branch hazard is encountered, we normally have to stall the pipeline: insert a pipeline bubble (NOPs).
* Rather than wait for value, can **guess** value!
  - Those instructions that depend on that value are executing **internally** (their results not architecturally visible). 
  - If the speculatively used value was **correct**, those instructions are valid and can **retire** (become architecturally visible).
  - Otherwise, those instructions are invalid and must be squashed.
  - Following the squash, the processor can resume execution with the correct value.

# Putting it all together
![h:550](skylake_block_diagram.png) ![h:550](skylake_block_diagram2.png)

---
# Branch Prediction
* The Branch Target Buffer (**BTB**) keeps a mapping from addresses of recently executed branch instructions to destination addresses.
* Branch History Buffer (**BHB**) use the previous branch history as the footprint to improve the accuracy of branch predictions.
* Bad programming pattern may reduce branch prediction accuracy: [How many "if"s are too many?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/branch-predictor/)

# Spectre V1 PoC
* [Spectre Paper](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
* ![](Conditional_Branch_Example.png)
* The code fragment begins with a bounds check on x which
is essential for security. In particular, this check **prevents** the
processor from reading sensitive memory **outside of array1**.
* What if we supplying x = (address of a **secret byte** to read) − (base address of array1) and a **branch misprediction** occurred?
* https://github.com/Eugnis/spectre-attack

# Spectre V1 wrap-up
*  Key ideas: **mistrains** the CPU's branch predictor, causing the CPU to temporarily **violate program semantics** by executing code that would not have been executed otherwise.
* The unoptimized implementation of the above PoC can read around **10 KB/s** on an i7-4650U with a low (< 0.01%) error rate.
* Can be **remotely exploited** by code hosted on web pages, for example interpreted languages like **JavaScript**, which run locally using a **web browser**. The scripted malware would then have access to all the memory mapped to the address space of the running browser.

# Meltdown PoC
* [Meltdown Paper](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
* ![h:70](meltdown-poc-1.png)![h:150](meltdown-poc-2.png)
* Line 4 reads from a kernel address, the load **succeed internally**, but will raise an exception when this instruction **retired**.
* Line 5-7 might be executed **before** line 4 retired due to OoO.
* When line 4 is retired, the **exception** is registered, and the **pipeline** is flushed to eliminate all results of subsequent instructions.

---
# Meltdown PoC
* Meltdown consists of 3 steps:
  1. The content of an attacker-chosen memory location, which is inaccessible to the attacker, is **loaded** into a register.
  2. A transient instruction **accesses** a cache line based on the secret content of the register.
  3. The attacker uses **Flush+Reload** to determine the accessed cache line and hence the secret stored at the chosen memory location.

---
# Meltdown wrap-up
* Key ideas: 
  1. Each process has a single full page table. 
  2. Vulnerable out-of-order CPUs allow an unprivileged process to load data from a privileged address.
  3. There is a race condition between raising the exception and a cache attack.
* The PoC can read **582 KB/s** with a low error rate on i7-8700K.
* Meltdown **breaks** all security guarantees provided by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments.

* Spectre V1 (Bounds Check Bypass)
  - **Compiler** change; Recompiled **system binaries** distributed by Windows Updates.
  - Edge & IE11 **hardened** to prevent exploit from JavaScript.
* Meltdown (Rogue Data Cache Load)
  - **Isolate** kernel and user mode **page tables**.

# Mitigations - Performance
![h:500](mitigations-performance.png)

---
# Mitigations - MSVC /Qspectre
* For Intel and similar processors the **LFENCE** instruction will stop younger instructions from executing, even speculatively, before older instructions have retired. 
* An LFENCE instruction inserted **after a bounds check** will **prevent** younger operations from executing before the bound check retires. Therefore it can act as a **speculation barrier**.
* The MSVC compiler has been updated with support for the /Qspectre switch which will **automatically** insert one of these **speculation barriers** when the compiler **detects** instances of variant 1.

# Mitigations - KPTI
* [The current state of kernel page-table isolation](https://lwn.net/Articles/741878/)
* In old kernels, each process has a **single** page global directory (PGD). one of the first steps taken in the KPTI is to create a **second** PGD.
* The original remains in use when the kernel is running; it maps the full address space. The second is made active when the process is running in **user space**. It points to the same directory hierarchy for pages belonging to the process itself, but the portion describing kernel space is **mostly absent**.
* **Switch** page table when enter/exit kernel space.

---
# Mitigations - KPTI
* KPTI will affect performance for anything that does **system calls** or **interrupts**. Just the new instructions (CR3 manipulation) add a few hundred cycles to a syscall or interrupt.
* Old CPUs (without PCIDs) require a **TLB flush** when switching the page table, which hurt performance badly.
* For database engine PostgreSQL the impact on read-only tests on an Intel Skylake processor was 7–17% (or 16–23% without PCIDs). [link](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20180102222354.qikjmf7dvnjgbkxe%40alap3.anarazel.de)
